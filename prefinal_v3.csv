It has never broken down and has never been in an accident. I have taken care of it to the best of my ability, and it still runs very well and is quite fun to drive (gotta love a turbo). With that being said, it’s nearly 13 years old and has over 200,000 miles, so naturally it requires a little extra maintenance. 

Features:
-Panoramic Sunroof/Moonroof
-Bluetooth and SiriusXM compatibility
-Heated/electric seats
-Keyless entry and ignition 
-All-weather rubber floor mats

A few things to note: 
-Front left parking light is out, however driving lights work perfectly.
-Small oil leak
-Engine light is on due to a sensor in exhaust manifold.
-Tire pressure light is stuck on, but can be turned off by a Volkswagen dealership.
-Diesel Particle Filter light turns on and off while driving, likely due to a faulty sensor.
-Small dent on rear drivers side door due to a low-speed parking lot collision (visible in second photo) See less","Driven 203,389 milesAutomatic transmissionExterior color: Silver · Interior color: BlackSafety ratingFuel type: Diesel29.0 MPG city · 37.0 MPG highway · 32.0 MPG combined3+ ownersThis vehicle is paid offClean title"

If you are not interested in fixing up this car, it is not for you. If this post is up, it means the car is still for sale. Don't hesitate to contact me for any questions.

In terms of cosmetic condition of the car, it is in good shape. I had the car stored for a while and replaced the tires and battery at Costco only to be hit with warning lights and bubbling in the coolant tank with a film of oil. It is likely a head gasket issue as these cars are known for.

The only code showing is P0171

The price is a little higher because of the brand-new tires, roof basket, and custom stereo system in the car. I'm willing to remove some of those items to bring down the price.

It’s been a blast to own for the last 4 years. I love knowing that I’m driving one of 1,100 units world wide. I have the maintenance records dating back to 2009 from maintenance I’ve done and previous owners as well

As with any old car is has some issues. Most notable is the paint has started to fade on the roof. The gas gauge isn’t always accurate, some interior lights don’t work, the passenger seat heater works intermittently, there is a chirping from the water pump bearing when the car first starts, the control arm bushings need to be replaced, they creak sometimes. 

My only reason for selling is I just don’t drive it enough, and don’t have space to keep it currently

It has never broken down and has never been in an accident. I have taken care of it to the best of my ability, and it still runs very well and is quite fun to drive (gotta love a turbo). With that being said, it’s nearly 13 years old and has over 200,000 miles, so naturally it requires a little extra maintenance. 

Features:
-Panoramic Sunroof/Moonroof
-Bluetooth and SiriusXM compatibility
-Heated/electric seats
-Keyless entry and ignition 
-All-weather rubber floor mats

A few things to note: 
-Front left parking light is out, however driving lights work perfectly.
-Small oil leak
-Engine light is on due to a sensor in exhaust manifold.
-Tire pressure light is stuck on, but can be turned off by a Volkswagen dealership.
-Diesel Particle Filter light turns on and off while driving, likely due to a faulty sensor.
-Small dent on rear drivers side door due to a low-speed parking lot collision (visible in second photo) See less","Driven 203,389 milesAutomatic transmissionExterior color: Silver · Interior color: BlackSafety ratingFuel type: Diesel29.0 MPG city · 37.0 MPG highway · 32.0 MPG combined3+ ownersThis vehicle is paid offClean title"

If you are not interested in fixing up this car, it is not for you. If this post is up, it means the car is still for sale. Don't hesitate to contact me for any questions.

In terms of cosmetic condition of the car, it is in good shape. I had the car stored for a while and replaced the tires and battery at Costco only to be hit with warning lights and bubbling in the coolant tank with a film of oil. It is likely a head gasket issue as these cars are known for.

The only code showing is P0171

The price is a little higher because of the brand-new tires, roof basket, and custom stereo system in the car. I'm willing to remove some of those items to bring down the price.
